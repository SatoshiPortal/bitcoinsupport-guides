# Advanced Sending Options

### After clicking on `Send`, tap the three-dot menu in the top right corner:

#### Allow Fee Bump

Keeping this option enabled will allow you to increase the fee you pay for the transaction you are sending in case the network fees rise above the one you entered and wish to get your transaction approved faster.&#x20;

The increase fee option will appear in your pending transaction. Simply click on it and enter a new fee amount.

#### **Add Recipient**

If you have two or more transactions to make, you can enter additional recipient addresses and the respective amounts you wish to send. This feature allows you to spend less fees versus sending them out individually. Simply add the address and amount for every recipient you wish to send to. You can add as many recipients as you like.
