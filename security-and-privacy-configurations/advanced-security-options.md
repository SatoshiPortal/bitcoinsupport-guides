# Advanced Security Options

BlueWallet offers several advanced options that will greatly improve the security of your funds and your privacy.

### On the main menu, go to the three-dot menu in the top right corner, select `Security`:&#x20;

#### Biometrics / Face ID&#x20;

Once enabled, biometrics will be required for making a transaction, unlocking, exporting or deleting a wallet.

#### Encrypted and Password Protected&#x20;

Your phone has multi-layer encryption on top of which BlueWallet can encrypt everything with an added password. This password will be required before you can access your wallet. You should enter a strong enough password which wonâ€™t be easily guessed by an attacker. We recommend **10 alphanumeric characters.**

#### Plausible Deniability&#x20;

This acts as a secondary storage access in case you are faced with a situation in which you must unlock your wallet to show funds, but do not wish to divulge your full balance. You will be asked to create a new password and to confirm it. Once completed, you will have access to a secondary BlueWallet wallet dashboard. Your main wallet and its accounts will not appear.
