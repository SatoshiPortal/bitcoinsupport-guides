# Security Basics

BlueWallet is one of the safest ways you can use Bitcoin if you are not using a hardware wallet or a "multisignature" custody setup.

* The wallet is open-source and has been reviewed independently to make sure there is no malware or backdoor.
* The developers cannot have access to your Bitcoin wallet.
* The private keys that control the bitcoins are encrypted on your phone and protected with a passphrase. To spend money each time you must decrypt your device with your app's password or with your biometrics.
* BlueWallet protects you well against non-hacker people that gain access to your phone.
* BlueWallet is more vulnerable to malware and hackers than hardware wallets.
* BlueWallet lets you create backups easily and securely which let you recover access to your money if your computer is damaged, lost or stolen.
