# Passphrase Security Basics

* Write down the passphrase you want to use before entering it in your device.&#x20;
* Use a combination of words as a passphrase to have less trouble remembering it.
* Use at least 12 characters in your passphrase, 24 characters offer more security. &#x20;
* If someone has access to your seed phrase, the passphrase will prevent them from taking your bitcoins.
* Create a unique passphrase that nobody can guess but that you can remember.&#x20;
* If you lose the passphrase, you lose access to your bitcoins forever (if you also lose access to your device).&#x20;
* You cannot change your passphrase. You can only create a new one, which in turn will generate a new wallet.&#x20;
* The passphrase is required to recover your access to your bitcoins if your device is damaged, lost or stolen.
